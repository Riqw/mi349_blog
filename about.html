          <p>My name is Tariq Williams, I am a Media & Information major at Michigan State University. I was in born in the year of 1998, via Lansing, Michigan. I've lived in Michigan for most of my life, but I travel to three new places around the world each year. I didn't know what I was interested in until my last year of college. I've decided that I'm going to study computers, css, software development, etc.</p>

          <p>I created this blog in order to write about things that I'm interested in. The future content of this blog will consist of: Movie/Game/Comic Book Reviews, General Thoughts, and anything else I can think of! I'm hoping to see this blog grow larger in size throughout time. The blog is called The Fantastic 88 because I plan on having 88 fantasitc and hardworking individuals who will help me write reviews for this website. I love to blog as a side hobby, I'm hoping to see this hard work pay off someday.</p>
